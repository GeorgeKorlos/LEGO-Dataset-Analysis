# LEGO Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes LEGO sets data sourced from Rebrickable. The analysis explores various aspects of LEGO's history, set complexity, and trends across themes, providing insights into the evolution of LEGO products over time.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Dive into the colorful world of LEGO pieces and analyze different attributes like colors, themes, and set complexity.
- **LEGO Sets Analysis**: Explore questions like:
  - What is the largest LEGO set in terms of parts?
  - How did LEGO's product offerings expand over the years?
  - Which theme is the most popular?
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the growth in the number of LEGO sets and themes over the years using Matplotlib.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

You can install the required libraries using pip:
